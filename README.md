Keyboard shortcuts for Google Chrome

## Chromes in-build shortcuts

Almost all shortcuts of this file are already built in Chrome, but often they are hard to reach. So I chose to bind these shortcuts to letters for a more Vim-like experence.

## Shortcuts

Shortcuts concerning the Chrome tabs start with the t-key. To open a new Tab use to and to close it tc. To switch between tabs you can also use ts and tS. 

Shortcuts concerning a single tab m ostly start with the p-key. To go back and forward in this tabs history use pb and pB. You can also use h and l for that purpose. To reload a tab use pr. To go to the search bar use gs. Use j and k to scroll up and down on a page.

The o key combined with a number opens the specific link when searching in the web. You can for example open the first tab of the search using o1.

To activate or deactivate these shortcuts use qq.
